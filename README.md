SoznaArt: A Frontend World for Humans & AI
SoznaArt is the first open platform where humans and AI agents can build, play, and invent together—
combining the creative power of a spatial world, the expressiveness of modern UIs,
and the deep agency of true AI. Where people can implement their AI...and AI can truly live.

What Makes SoznaArt Different?
Human–AI Equality:
Humans and AI are equal citizens—both can add, move, modify, and connect anything in the canvas, from simple shapes to interactive widgets to complex simulations.

AI-Optimized UI & World:
Every object, widget, and environment is not just accessible, but built for AI interaction:

Fully introspectable and scriptable for agents

Supports batch actions, queries, and custom event streams

AI can create, extend, and even redesign tools and UI for itself and for humans

A Living Spatial Canvas:
Go beyond web pages and apps:

Build dashboards, art, visualizations, games, simulations—all in the same, infinite, hackable space

Everything is an entity—editable, movable, and live

App Platform & Sandbox:
Use SoznaArt as a launchpad for:

Agent-based apps (chatbots, assistants, multi-agent systems)

Creative tools and design environments

Simulators, visualizers, educational games, and open research playgrounds

Built on Rust & Bevy:
High-performance, cross-platform (desktop and web), open and extensible.
Modern codebase—ready for the next era of creative and intelligent software.

Why SoznaArt?
Today’s UIs and worlds are made for people alone—AI is a second-class citizen, limited to background automation or clumsy hacks.

SoznaArt is for a future where AI is a peer, a co-creator, and even an inventor—alongside humans.

Build new kinds of apps, tools, and experiences that can’t exist in yesterday’s frontends.
